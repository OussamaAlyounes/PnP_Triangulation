# PnP_Triangulation
The aim of this project is to get the Transformation matrix between the coordinated of the base of a robot arm and the coordinated of the surface of an electric car socket. Here we assume that there is a calibrated camera mounted on the tcp of the robot. This problem was solved knowing some keypoints on the socket. All the images and the keypoints are gotten using this camera.
Two approaches were used to get the rotation and transformation between the socket and the base coordinates. The first approach is PnP and the second one is Triangulation. The solution depends on the built-in functions in CV2 library. This project can deal with big amount of data and gives all the necessary statistics analysis.
There are three main files. The first one is "pos_rotation_statistics.py" which is a class to help analysing the data. It gives the mean, std and and plot the data with the 3-sigma error boundaries. The second file is "triangulation_solution" which is a class to solve the problem using Triangulation method, it gives the rotation and translation between the socket and the base of the arm robot. And the third file is "pnp_solution.py" which solves the problem using the PnP method. Both methods assume that the camera is calibrated.
There is a fourth file, "Final_Project.ipynb" which is the a file that uses the previous three classes to analysis the data that I have. You only have to change the location of where your images and keypoints are stored.
